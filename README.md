## How To Install
-------------
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb
cd keti
make -j 4
```

## Modules
-------------
### CSD Input Interface
-------------
A module that receives the snippet delivered by the Storage Engine Node.

Parsing the received snippet and storing it in a structure that can be used inside the CSD

Check the snippet information, divide it into scan, scan&filter operations, and deliver it to the corresponding parallel execution queue

### CSD Scanning
-------------
Module that reads table data inside CSD

Read data by accessing the block device as a PBA (Physical Block Address) rather than through the file system

### CSD Filtering
-------------
Module that performs Where conditional filtering on blocks scanned by CSD Scanning

CSD Filtering module operates based on Where clause

<pre>
<code>
//loop row
for (int i = 0; i < rowcount; i++)
    {
        //loop whereclause
        for (int j = 0; j < whereclause.Size(); j++)
        {
            switch (whereclause operator)
                {
</code>
</pre>

### CSD Merge Manager
-------------
Module that merges scanned and filtered data

Considering that the data will be reduced after the CSD Filtering module operates, the number of communication is reduced by combining blocks.

### CSD Return Interface
-------------
A module that delivers the data merged by the CSD Merge Manager to the Buffer manager of the Storage Engine Node.

Merge information is delivered in JSON format, and merge data is delivered in raw data format.

## Governance
